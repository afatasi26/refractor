# Code Refactor
Personally, this assignment was a little confusing as to what it needed me to do. Initially I noticed the search-engine-optimization link did not link to the section, so I corrected it. Folling that, I added alt tags to all of the images in order to make the site more accessible to all browsers and screen readers. I then re-organized the CSS to better group together classes, ids, and other related text with eachother. Finally, I added comments in the CSS for the sections and what was contained inside of them in the index.html file.
